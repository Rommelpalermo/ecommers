# How to Add the iPhone Image to Smartphone Pro

## What I've Done:
✅ Updated the database to link the iPhone image to "Smartphone Pro" product (ID: 1)
✅ Set the image filename as: `iphone-pro-purple.jpg`
✅ Created the uploads directory
✅ Product now expects the image at: `uploads/iphone-pro-purple.jpg`

## What You Need to Do:

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
1. **Save your iPhone image** from the attachment you showed me
2. **Rename it to:** `iphone-pro-purple.jpg`
3. **Place it in:** `c:\xampp\htdocs\Ecommers\uploads\`
4. **Make sure it's a web-compatible format** (JPG, PNG, or WebP)

### Option 2: Using the Admin Panel (If available)
1. Go to the admin product management section
2. Edit the "Smartphone Pro" product
3. Upload the iPhone image through the interface

## File Structure Should Look Like:
```
c:\xampp\htdocs\Ecommers\
├── uploads/
│   └── iphone-pro-purple.jpg  <-- Your iPhone image goes here
├── product.php
├── products.php
└── index.php
```

## Verification:
After placing the image, visit:
- Product page: http://localhost:8000/product.php?id=1
- Products listing: http://localhost:8000/products.php
- Homepage: http://localhost:8000/ (if featured)

## Database Status:
✅ Product ID: 1

The system is now ready to display your iPhone image once you place the file in the uploads directory!
